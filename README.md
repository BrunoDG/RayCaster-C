# RayCaster in C

So, as a game developer, I definitely want to study some more concepts of visualization and creation to expand my capabilities.
As a dream of a child who spent his early teen years playing Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM and Quake, it was since I know myself as a person, a dream to recreate the same game and understand how it works from behind the scenes.

For any doubts, this is the first understanding of how the code and engine works. I'm following this series on YouTube from 3DSage to make my own Raycaster in C, so then I can move on to Rust and Zig, for studying purposes as well.

Please go to the channel, watch him and make a thumbs up for that! He deserves it (and no, it's not me, by the way).
